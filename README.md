# Q&A:

Q: Why npm run dev uses **node**, not **ts-node**?  
A: https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-node#programmatic

Q: Why in launch.json port set to 9229?  
A: Node default inspect port is 9229 https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/debugging-getting-started/
You can specify port by change --inspect=<PORT> in package.json and launch.json

Q: How to debug both server and client?  
A: Use "Start both" configuration. More: https://github.com/fuse-box/fuse-box/blob/master/docs/guides/debugging-with-vscode.md#server-debugging

Q: Why we used bundle.js in our HTML template?  
A: Explanation how it works:
   1. The server renders markups with renderToString
   2. We have got only plain text document without any JS
   3. Bundle.js is loaded and create Inferno instance, that "clings" DOM
   4. Inferno binds events

Q: I have an error  
A: Please submit new issue with detailed description of your problem

Q: How to use it with Azure?  
A: Create Azure Web Index for Linux and upload docker container. Then you should set variable WEBSITES_PORT to 80 (or any other that you used in server/index.ts) in Index settings section.
